# ChatBox Migration Plan - May 18, 2025

## Project Overview
ChatBox is currently using:
- Client: React 19.1.0 with Create React App (CRA)
- Server: Express with TypeScript
- Dependencies: Various, with some security vulnerabilities in client-side dependencies

## Current Status
Recent updates:
- Updated client packages:
  - `@testing-library/user-event`: 13.5.0 → 14.6.1
  - `web-vitals`: 2.1.4 → 5.0.1
- Implemented Content Security Policy
- TypeScript migration for server components completed

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate Security Improvements (Complete)
1. ✓ **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
   - Added appropriate CSP headers in the server
   - Headers set to restrict script sources to trusted origins
   - Implemented inline script hashing where needed
   - Documentation updated

2. **Runtime Protection (Next Step)**
   - Add [DOMPurify](https://github.com/cure53/DOMPurify) to client code
   - Sanitize all user-generated markdown/content before rendering
   - Implementation target: By May 25, 2025

### Phase 2: Technical Debt Reduction (Weeks 1-2)
1. **Client TypeScript Migration**
   - Convert remaining JavaScript files to TypeScript
   - Add proper type definitions
   - Timeline: Start May 20, complete by June 3
   - Success metric: 100% TypeScript coverage in client code

2. **Evaluate Modern Tooling Options**
   - Research and compare:
     - Vite: For faster dev experience and modern build tools
     - Next.js: For SSR/SSG capabilities if needed
     - Remix: For more integrated data loading
   - Create POC (Proof of Concept) for preferred solution
   - Timeline: Complete evaluation by June 10
   - Deliverable: Technical recommendation document

3. **Client Library Alternatives**
   - Test alternatives to vulnerable libraries:
     - Replace `react-syntax-highlighter` with:
       - `highlight.js` with React wrapper
       - `shiki` for VS Code-like highlighting
     - Evaluate performance and security of each option
   - Timeline: Complete by June 5

### Phase 3: Full Migration (Weeks 3-4)
1. **Incremental Migration to Modern Build Tools**
   - Assuming Vite is selected (adjust if different tool chosen):
     - Set up new Vite project structure
     - Migrate components and utilities one by one
     - Ensure tests pass at each stage
     - Update build and deployment pipelines
   - Timeline: Start June 10, complete by June 24

2. **Testing and Validation**
   - Perform comprehensive testing:
     - Unit/component tests
     - Integration tests
     - Performance benchmarking
     - Security vulnerability scanning
   - Fix any issues discovered during testing
   - Timeline: June 25-30

3. **Cutover and Deployment**
   - Deploy new version to staging
   - Perform final validation
   - Schedule production deployment
   - Timeline: By July 5
