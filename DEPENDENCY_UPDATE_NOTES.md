# Dependency Update Notes - May 18, 2025

## Summary
This document tracks package updates and known vulnerability issues in the ChatBox application.

## Updated Packages

### Client
- `@testing-library/user-event`: 13.5.0 → 14.6.1
- `web-vitals`: 2.1.4 → 5.0.1

### Server
- All packages are up to date with latest dependencies as of May 18, 2025
- Server uses TypeScript for improved type safety and developer experience

## Known Vulnerability Issues

The client has several vulnerabilities in nested dependencies from React Scripts:

1. `nth-check` < 2.0.1 - High severity
   - Used by SVG processing libraries
   - Fixing requires breaking changes to `react-scripts`
   - Impact: Potential ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service)

2. `postcss` < 8.4.31 - Moderate severity
   - Used by CSS processing
   - Fixing requires breaking changes to `react-scripts`
   - Impact: Line return parsing vulnerability

3. `prismjs` < 1.30.0 - Moderate severity 
   - Used by syntax highlighting in `react-syntax-highlighter`
   - Fixing requires downgrading `react-syntax-highlighter` to 5.8.0
   - Impact: DOM Clobbering vulnerability

## Security Mitigations Implemented

1. **Content Security Policy**
   - Implemented strict CSP headers on the server
   - Limits script execution to trusted sources
   - Protects against XSS attacks that could exploit client-side vulnerabilities

2. **Proper Error Handling**
   - Implemented comprehensive error logging
   - Prevents exposing sensitive information in stack traces

## Recommended Actions

1. Consider migrating away from Create React App to Vite or Next.js
   - See MIGRATION_PLAN.md for detailed steps

2. For immediate security improvements:
   - Monitor application logs for suspicious activities
   - Keep development dependencies updated to latest versions
   - Consider implementing additional client-side security measures like DOMPurify

3. Follow security best practices:
   - Regular vulnerability scanning
   - Keep all dependencies updated when possible
   - Implement proper input validation
