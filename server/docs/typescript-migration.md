# TypeScript Migration Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the migration of the ChatBox server codebase from JavaScript to TypeScript. The migration was completed on May 18, 2025, improving code quality, type safety, and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Added
- `typescript`: The TypeScript compiler
- `ts-node`: For running TypeScript code directly
- `ts-node-dev`: For development with automatic reloading
- Type definitions:
  - `@types/node`
  - `@types/express`
  - `@types/cors`
  - `@types/express-winston`

### 2. Configuration Files
- Created `tsconfig.json` with strict TypeScript configuration
- Updated npm scripts in `package.json`:
  - `build`: Compiles TypeScript to JavaScript
  - `start`: Runs the compiled JavaScript
  - `dev`: Runs the TypeScript code directly with ts-node
  - `dev:watch`: Runs the TypeScript code with automatic reloading

### 3. File Conversions
All JavaScript files were converted to TypeScript:
- `.js` files renamed to `.ts`
- Added type annotations to variables, functions, and API endpoints
- Created comprehensive type definitions in `types/index.ts`

### 4. Type Definitions
Created type definitions for:
- Ollama API requests and responses
- Server middleware and controllers
- Logging system
- Rate limiter configuration

### 5. Build Process
- TypeScript compilation configured to output to `dist/` directory
- Source maps enabled for easier debugging
- Declaration files generated for API types

## Running the Server

### Development Mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Production Mode
```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Type Safety Benefits

The migration to TypeScript provides several benefits:
1. **Error Prevention**: Catch type-related errors at compile-time rather than runtime
2. **Better IDE Support**: Improved autocomplete and IntelliSense capabilities
3. **Self-Documentation**: Types serve as documentation for the codebase
4. **Refactoring Confidence**: TypeScript helps ensure refactors don't break existing functionality

## API Contracts

The defined TypeScript interfaces serve as contracts between the client and server, ensuring:
1. Consistent data structures
2. Proper parameter validation
3. Clear error handling
4. Documented API endpoints

## Testing Post-Migration

All endpoints were manually tested to ensure they function correctly after the migration:
- Health check: `/health`
- Ollama health: `/api/ollama/health`
- Ollama models: `/api/ollama/tags`
- Chat streaming: `/api/ollama/chat`
- Log access: `/logs` and `/logs/html`

## Maintenance Guidelines

When adding new features or modifying the codebase:
1. Define types for all new functions and variables
2. Update type definitions if API contracts change
3. Use TypeScript's utility types when applicable (`Partial<T>`, `Omit<T>`, etc.)
4. Run the TypeScript compiler to ensure type safety before committing changes
5. Consider adding automated tests for TypeScript validation
